&lt;p&gt;This is my first time making a website and I wanted to say that this website is for a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had spent a lot of time figuring out how to set it up. I watch ten youtube videoes and until I found the right one that is up to date and does not require a lot of other programs. I thought of using the Django at first but stuck with Pelican. The video that help me was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=166eHphex2k"&gt;youtube.com/watch?v=166eHphex2k&lt;/a&gt;. It was hard to listen too but the step were easy to follow and works. I suggest y'all should check it out if you are struggling. Additionally, I had to learn a new language. I have had previous projects that required me to create a website on a server in HTML but this project was totally different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; for the website which is a static site generator, written in Python that requires no database or server-side logic.
